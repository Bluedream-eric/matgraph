# matgraph

**matgraph** is a suite of Matlab programs for working with simple graphs. 
Please be sure to read the documentation in the docs folder.

## Development of this package is halted

I have stopped work on matgraph. I provide it here for those who might find it useful. 
As an alternative, Sage has an excellent suite of graph theory tools and I have developed 
some code in Julia (available through my github repositories) as well.
