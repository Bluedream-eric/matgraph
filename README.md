# matgraph


Welcome to **matgraph**: A MATLAB toolbox for working with simple graphs
(undirected graphs without loops or multiple edges). 

There is documentation in the `doc` directory and web-based information
in the `html` directory. 

To install, placed the directory `matgraph` anywhere that is
convenient. Use MATLAB's `addpath` command to include a link to this
directory. 

Graph variables behave a bit differently from standard MATLAB
variables. Please be sure to read `matgraph.pdf` to understand how to
use this package. 

In addition to the graph class, we also include classes for
permutations and partitions. 

Please read the copyright notice. This software is distributed under
the GNU General Purpose License (see gpl.txt). 


## Development of this package is halted

I have stopped work on matgraph. I provide it here for those who might
find it useful.  As an alternative, Sage has an excellent suite of
graph theory tools and I have developed some code in Julia (available
through my github repositories) as well. 
Start here: <https://github.com/scheinerman/SimpleGraphs.jl.git>.
